# Data Management

The Camelot Builder is a data-driven application. The accuracy, consistency, and structure of the game data are critical to the calculator's functionality and reliability. This section outlines the plan for managing this data.

Effective data management is a prerequisite for nearly every other feature in the application, from the UI to the validation engine.

## Features

1.  **[Data Sourcing](./01-data-sourcing.md)**: This document describes the strategy for collecting the vast amount of information required, including class lists, Realm Ability details, costs, and prerequisites.

2.  **[Data Structure](./02-data-structure.md)**: This document defines the schema for the data, likely in JSON format. A well-designed data structure will make the application easier to build, maintain, and extend.
