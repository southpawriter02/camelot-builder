# Core Functionality

This section outlines the foundational features of the Camelot Builder application. These are the essential components that form the core of the Realm Ability calculator. Without these, the tool would not be functional.

The features described here are the minimum viable product (MVP) requirements. They are designed to provide a working, useful tool that can be expanded upon in later phases of development.

## Features

1.  **[Class Selection](./01-class-selection.md)**: The initial step for any user, allowing them to choose the class they want to build. This choice will determine the available Realm Abilities.

2.  **[RA Point Allocation](./02-ra-point-allocation.md)**: The primary interactive component of the calculator. This feature allows users to spend their Realm Points on various abilities and see the results in real-time.

3.  **[Build Validation](./03-build-validation.md)**: The logic engine that enforces the rules of the game. This ensures that all builds created with the tool are valid and could exist in Dark Age of Camelot.
