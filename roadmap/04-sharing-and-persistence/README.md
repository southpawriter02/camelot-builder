# Sharing and Persistence

A key goal of the Camelot Builder is to be a valuable community resource. This means allowing users to easily share their creations and to have their work persist between visits. These features are crucial for fostering community engagement and making the tool more convenient for regular users.

## Features

1.  **[Shareable Links](./01-shareable-links.md)**: This is a cornerstone feature that allows a user's entire build to be encoded into a URL. This makes it incredibly easy to share builds on forums, social media, or directly with friends.

2.  **[Local Storage Persistence](./02-local-storage-persistence.md)**: To improve the user experience for returning visitors, the calculator will automatically save the user's current build in their browser's local storage.
