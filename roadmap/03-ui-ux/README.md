# UI/UX

A powerful calculator is only useful if it's easy and enjoyable to use. This section focuses on the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) aspects of the Camelot Builder. The goal is to create a modern, intuitive, and visually appealing tool that feels fast and responsive.

Good UI/UX is not just about aesthetics; it's about clarity, feedback, and making a complex tool feel simple.
