# Advanced Features

This section outlines the long-term vision for the Camelot Builder. These are "stretch goals" that can be implemented after the core functionality is complete and stable. These features are designed to transform the tool from a simple calculator into a comprehensive character-building platform and a vibrant community hub.

## Features

1.  **[User Accounts](./01-user-accounts.md)**: Allowing users to create accounts to save, manage, and name their builds, providing a much more robust persistence solution than local storage.

2.  **[Popular Builds](./02-popular-builds.md)**: A community-driven feature that showcases popular, effective, or interesting builds for each class, helping new players and inspiring veterans.

3.  **[Item Database Integration](./03-item-database-integration.md)**: A highly ambitious feature to allow users to equip their character with in-game items and see how those items' bonuses affect their overall build and stats.
